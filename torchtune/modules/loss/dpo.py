class DPOLoss(nn.Module):
    """
    Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) Loss module: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290.
    Simply stated from the paper:

        Intuitively, the DPO update increases the relative log probability of preferred to dispreferred responses,
        but it incorporates a dynamic, per-example importance weight that prevents
        the model degeneration that we find occurs with a naive probability ratio objective.

    Based on the implementation in HF's TRL library:
    https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/5d1deb1445828cfd0e947cb3a7925b1c03a283fc/trl/trainer/dpo_trainer.py#L844

    DPO retains similarities to PPO (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01325), where it optimizes a policy
    (language) model to align with human preferences, and regularizes the loss function using a baseline
    reference (the frozen, initial language model) to prevent over-fitting to the preference dataset.
    It differs from PPO by optimizing the policy model directly using labelled preference data, rather
    than using an additional reward model to provide feedback.
    This significantly simplifies training and reduces compute overhead.

    Args:
        beta (float): Temperature parameter for the DPO loss, typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.5. Default is 0.1.

    Intuition from the paper:

        (Given a policy pi and reference policy, pi_ref)

        IPO learns from preferences dataset simply by regressing the gap between log-likelihood ratios

        log(pi(chosen)/pi(rejected)) and log(pi_ref(chosen)/pi_ref(rejected))

        to 1/(2*tau), where tau is the temperature parameter. [T]he weaker the regularisation becomes, the
        higher would be the log-likelihood ratio of chosen to rejected logprobs. In other words IPO, unlike DPO,
        always regularizes its solution towards pi_ref by controlling the gap between the log-likelihood ratios

        log(pi(chosen)/pi(rejected)) and log(pi_ref(chosen)/pi_ref(rejected))

        thus avoiding the over-fitting to the preference dataset.

        tau (float): Equivalent temperature scaling parameter (from DPO) for the IPO loss. From the TRL documentation:

            the [tau] parameter is the reciprocal of the gap between the log-likelihood ratios of the

class SimPOLoss(nn.Module):
    """
    SimPO: Simple Preference Optimization with a Reference-Free Reward: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14734.
    Intuition from the paper:

        The effectiveness of SimPO is attributed to a key design: using the average log probability of a sequence as
        the implicit reward. Additionally, we introduce a target reward margin to the Bradley-Terry objective to
        encourage a larger margin between the winning and losing responses, further enhancing the algorithm's performance.

    Based on the TRL implementation:

    SimPO is pretty much identitcal to DPO but uses average logprobs to eliminate the need for a reference model to regularize
    the policy during training. It also uses a target reward margin to guide the policy towards better responses.
    This is kind of the same intuition in:class:`~torchtune.modules.loss.IPO`, but instead of optimizing against a margin
    between the reference policy and policy models, we're optimizing against a margin between the chosen and rejected responses.
