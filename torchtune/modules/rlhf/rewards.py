    Calculates a mask to penalise scores corresponding to sequences generated during PPO, where True indicates the score

    e.g. by :func:`torchtune.modules.rlhf.sequence_processing.truncate_sequence_at_first_stop_token`.

    Scores are penalised such that:
    - If ``min_response_length`` is set, scores for sequences with ``length < min_response_length`` are penalised.
    - If ``penalise_no_eos`` is True, scores for sequences with no EOS token are penalised.

            sequence, and False otherwise. Shape: (b, reponse_len)
