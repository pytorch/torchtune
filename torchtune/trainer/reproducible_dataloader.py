class ReproducibleDataLoader(DataLoader):
    """
    A version of :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` that supports
    reproducing the order of iteration over the dataset and shuffling the
    iteration order across epoch boundaries through the ``seed`` parameter.
    This provides repeatibility in dataloading and transforms executed in dataloader workers.

    [Typical usage] If users don't pass in a sampler, then :class:`~torch.utils.
    data.DistributedSampler` is used and its `set_epoch` method is called every time iter is called on the `DataLoader.

    If users provide a custom sampler, then the sampler will be used as is and
    user is responsible for managing that sampler, including setting epoch. No
    reproducibility is guaranteed in this case.

    See :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` for arguments except ``seed``

    Args:
        seed (int, optional): Seed used to initialize a :class:`~torch.utils.
        data.DistributedSampler` sampler if no custom sampler is provided by the
        user. If no generator is provided, seed is also used to set the
        base_seed for all dataloader workers to ensure transforms are
        repeatable. If no seed is provided, a random number is used as the seed.
