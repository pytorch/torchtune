    """Utility to setup distributed training using the torch.distributed FullyShardedDataParallel (FSDP) module.
    FSDP allows three primary types of data parallel training (these can be set under "strategy"):

    NO_SHARD:
        No sharding is done, this is standard Data Parallel training. The is typically fastest if the entire
        model and optimizer can fit on a single GPU and you just want to split the batch across ranks.
    SHARD_GRAD_OP:
        Only gradients and optimizer are sharded across all ranks. This is typically fastest when the
        model can fit on your GPU but there isn't enough room for a forward and backward pass.
    FULL_SHARD:
        All parameters are sharded across all ranks. This is necessary when even the model cannot fit on a
        single GPU.

    If using sharding, you need to define how the model is sharded. The auto_wrap_policy is a list of model layers
    and blocks that FSDP will use as shards.

    Args:
        model (nn.Module): Model to wrap for distributed training.
        device (torch.device): Device for host model.
        dtype (torch.dtype): dtype for mixed precision training. FSDP mixed precision will be
            configured to use this dtype for both computation and communication.
        strategy (Optional[str]): Sharding strategy to use. Please see
            torch.distributed.fsdp.ShardingStrategy for options. Default: "FULL_SHARD", which
            shards parameters, gradients, and optimizer states.
        auto_wrap_policy (Optional[Union[Set[Type], FSDPPolicyType]]): nn.Module types to recursively apply FSDP to.
            FSDP will wrap each instance of the specified nn.Module type in its own atomic FSDP unit.
            Alternatively, this can be a custom callable policy of type FSDPPolicyType, in which case FSDP will
            be wrapped according to the specified policy.
            Please see https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_adavnced_tutorial.html#transformer-wrapping-policy
            for details on FSDP wrapping and writing wrapping policies.
            Default: None. In this case, FSDP is only applied to the top level module. In this
            case, entire model is unsharded during computation and memory is only saved due to
            sharding optimizer states.
        cpu_offload (bool): Whether to offload sharded parameters to CPU. Default: False
        **kwargs: additional arguments to pass to FSDP for distributed training.

    Returns:
        nn.Module: Model wrapped for distributed training

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If environment not setup for distributed training.

    NOTE:
        Please use caution if running with cpu_offload=True, as this is known to have
        significant training performance issues at the moment.
