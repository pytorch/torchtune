    Trie in Python. Creates a Trie out of a list of words. The trie is used to split on `added_tokens` in one pass

        Passes over every char (utf-8 char) on word and recursively adds it to the internal `data` trie representation.
        The special key `""` is used to represent termination.

        This function is idempotent, adding twice the same word will leave the trie unchanged

        Example:
