class GemmaTransformerDecoder(nn.Module):
    """
    GemmaTransformer Decoder derived from Gemma architecture. A key difference between
    the Gemma transformer decoder and :class:`~torchtune.modules.TransformerDecoder`
    is that the output projection is replaced instead with a reverse projection
    using the transposed token embedding weights from output dim to input dim
    (see https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp/blob/master/keras_nlp/layers/modeling/reversible_embedding.py#L21).

    Args:
        tok_embeddings (nn.Embedding): PyTorch embedding layer, to be used to move
            tokens to an embedding space and as the output projection.
        layer (TransformerDecoderLayer): Transformer Decoder layer.
        num_layers (int): Number of Transformer Decoder layers.
        max_seq_len (int): maximum sequence length the model will be run with, as used
            by :func:`~torchtune.modules.KVCache`
        num_heads (int): number of query heads. For MHA this is also the
            number of heads for key and value. This is used to setup the
            :func:`~torchtune.modules.KVCache`
        head_dim (int): embedding dimension for each head in self-attention. This is used
            to setup the :func:`~torchtune.modules.KVCache`
        norm (nn.Module): Callable that applies normalization to the output of the decoder,
            before final MLP.
        norm_embeddings (bool): Whether to normalize the embeddings before passing them
            through the decoder layers. Defaults to False.

    Note:
        Arg values are checked for correctness (eg: ``attn_dropout`` belongs to [0,1])
        in the module where they are used. This helps reduces the number of raise
        statements in code and improves readability.

                with shape [b x s x s]. This is applied after the query-key multiplication and
                before the softmax. A value of True in row i and column j means token i attends

                During inference, this indicates the position of the current token.

        Note: At the very first step of inference, when the model is provided with a prompt,
        ``input_pos`` would contain the positions of all of the tokens in the prompt
        (eg: ``torch.arange(prompt_length)``). This is because we will need to compute the
