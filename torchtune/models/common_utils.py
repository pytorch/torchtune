    """
    A state_dict hook that replaces nf4 tensors with their restored
    higher-precision weight and optionally offloads the restored weight to CPU.

    This function is meant to be used with PyTorch's ``nn.Module._register_state_dict_hook``, i.e.
    >>> m = MyModule()
    >>> m._register_state_dict_hook(reparametrize_as_dtype_state_dict_post_hook)

    If the hook is registered per the above process, this hook will be called _after_ the module's
    ``state_dict`` method is called. The hook will replace all ``NF4Tensor`` instances by unquantizing
    them to the original dtype, and optionally offload the restored weight to CPU.

    Args:
        model (nn.Module): the model to take ``state_dict()`` on
        state_dict (Dict[str, Any]): the state dict to modify
        *args (Tuple[Any, ...]): Unused args passed when running this as a state_dict hook.
        dtype (torch.dtype): the dtype to restore the weight to. Default is ``torch.bfloat16``.
        offload_to_cpu (bool): whether to offload the restored weight to CPU. Default is ``True``.
        **kwargs (Dict[Any, Any]): Unused keyword args passed when running this as a state_dict hook.
