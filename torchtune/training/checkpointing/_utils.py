    Validates the state dict for checkpoint loading for a classifier model.

    Concretely, when fine-tuning a classifier model from the checkpoint of a base language model
    which has ``output.weight`` of shape ``[vocab_dim, embed_dim]``, we overwrite
    the ``output.weight`` in the state-dict to be loaded with the randomly initialized
