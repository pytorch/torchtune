class OffloadActivations(saved_tensors_hooks):
    """Context manager under which activation tensors created in the forward pass will be offloaded.

    Enable the memory efficiency technique of activation offloading, where activations bigger than
    min_offload_size bytes will be offloaded to CPU in the forward and brought back in the backward.
    This is in contrast to maintaining the activation on GPU VRAM throughout the program.

    This manager contains the option of using one additional CUDA stream to handle the communication
    between CUDA and CPU, which is intended to overlap with the default computation stream to improve
    runtime. We designed synchronization with a few heuristics for optimizing the tradeoff between
    runtime vs memory usage.

    Args:
        use_pin_memory (bool): Whether or not the offloaded Tensor will be placed in pinned
            memory on the CPU. Pinned memory allows the Tensor to be moved back onto GPU more quickly
            but is a limited resource. Default: True.

        use_streams (bool): Whether or not to use streams for performance optimization where
            the communications get overlapped with the computation. Requires a torch build
            after torch-2.5.0.]. Default: True.

        max_fwd_stash_size (int): The maximum size of the forward stash, or the maximum number of
            consecutive activations to keep alive during the forward pass. This number must be at
            least 1. Keeping alive more activations will potentially allow more overlap between the
            communication and compute streams at the cost of increasing memory usage. Keeping alive
            fewer activations will conserve memory, but may cause poor overlap between the streams,
            increasing runtime. Default: 5.

        min_offload_size (int): The minimum number of bytes a Tensor must be in order to qualify
            for offloading. If the tensor is too small, we do not want to waste bandwidth and resources
            moving it to CPU and back. Default: 1024 bytes.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if max_fwd_stash_size is not at least 1.
        RuntimeError: if use_streams but torch installation is earlier than torch-2.5.0.dev20240907

        >>> with OffloadActivations():
        >>>     logits = model(inputs)
        >>> loss = ...
        >>> loss.backward()
