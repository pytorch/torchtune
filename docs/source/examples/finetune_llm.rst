LLM Full Finetuning Recipe
==========================

The full fine-tune recipe updates all of the parameters of the model using supervised learning.
Given a model and a dataset comprising of input-label pairs, we train the model on these pairs using cross-entropy loss.

.. note::

  Full Fine-tuning is usually a lot more expensive that parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA, but
  can result in a higher quality model.


This recipe supports:

* :ref:`Mixed Precision Training<mp_label>`

* :ref:`Distributed Training with FSDP<dist_label>`

* :ref:`Activation Checkpointing<ac_label>`

This guide will walk you through the different aspects of the `recipe <https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/blob/main/recipes/full_finetune.py>`_.


An example config for training the Llama 7B model using the Alpaca dataset looks something like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Tokenizer
    tokenizer:
      _component_: torchtune.models.llama2.llama2_tokenizer
      path: /tmp/tokenizer.model

    # Dataset
    dataset:
      _component_: torchtune.datasets.alpaca_dataset
    shuffle: True

    # Model Arguments
    model:
      _component_: torchtune.models.llama2.llama2_7b
    model_checkpoint: /tmp/llama2-7b

    # Fine-tuning arguments
    batch_size: 2
    epochs: 3
    optimizer:
      _component_: torch.optim.SGD
      lr: 2e-5
    loss:
      _component_: torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss
    output_dir: /tmp/alpaca-llama2-finetune
    device: cuda
    dtype: fp32
    enable_fsdp: True
    enable_activation_checkpointing: True
    resume_from_checkpoint: False

To run the recipe without any changes on 4 GPUs, launch a training run using TuneCLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    tune --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node 4 full_finetune --config alpaca_llama2_full_finetune

Dataset
-------

In this example, we use :class:`~torchtune.datasets.alpaca_dataset`
from Stanford. The following parameters are related to the data:

.. code-block:: python

    # Point the dataset to the Alpaca Dataset implementation in TorchTune
    # This is set in the config
    dataset: alpaca_dataset

    # Don't mask the prompt during training
    # This is the default value
    train_on_input: True

    # Train on the raw data, not the cleaned version
    # This is the default value
    use_clean: False

    # Shuffle the data between epochs
    # This is set in the config
    shuffle: True

.. note::
    Shuffling the data after every epoch is a good practice. This helps makes sure the model does not learn
    spurious patterns related to the how the data is sequenced.

.. note::
    Set ``train_on_input`` to False if you want to learn on the label only i.e. mask out the prompt. The resulting loss
    will go down a lot slower.



Model
-----

In this example, we use the `Llama 7B model <https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/blob/main/torchtune/models/llama2.py>`_.
The following parameters are related to the model:

.. code-block:: python

    # Point the model to the default llama-7B model
    model: llama2_7b
    model_checkpoint: <PATH_TO_MODEL_CHECKPOINT>

    # Point to the default tokenizer for llama2
    tokenizer: llama2_tokenizer
    tokenizer_checkpoint: <PATH_TO_MODEL_TOKENIZER>

    # FSDP and Activation checkpointing are enabled
    enable_fsdp: True
    enable_activation_checkpointing: True


Training
--------

.. code-block:: python

    # Batch size refers to "local" batch size; global batch size is computed as
    # batch_size * num_gpus * gradient_accumulation_steps
    batch_size: 2
    lr: 2e-5
    epochs: 3

    optimizer: SGD

    epochs: 3
    loss: CrossEntropyLoss

    # default value corresponds to no accumulation
    gradient_accumulation_steps: 1

    # resume_from_checkpoint controls how the checkpoint is loaded at the beginning
    # of training; set this to True if a previously incomplete training is
    # restarting
    resume_from_checkpoint: False


.. note::
    The default optimizer is SGD instead of Adam since this uses less memory. Adam is known to result in better model
    quality.
