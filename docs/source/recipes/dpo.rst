====================================
Direct Preference Optimization
====================================

This recipe supports several `Direct Preference Optimization <https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290>`_ (DPO)-style fine-tuning techniques.
These techniques aim to steer (or `align <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment>`_) a model towards some desirable behaviours.
For example, a common goal is to train language models to produce safe and honest outputs,
or to be `helpful and harmless <https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05862>`_.

To see the best results when using this recipe, it may be helpful to first fine-tune your model with using supervised fine-tuning to ensure your model is
on-distribution for the domain you're interested in. To do this, check out our other fine-tuning recipes in the :ref:`recipe overview <recipes_overview_label>` which
support a variety of SFT paradigms.

After supervised fine-tuning, here is an example of DPO with Llama 3.1 8B:

.. note::

    You may need to be granted access to the Llama model you're interested in. See
    :ref:`here <download_llama_label>` for details on accessing gated repositories.


.. code-block:: bash

    tune download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
    --ignore-patterns "original/consolidated.00.pth"
    --HF_TOKEN <HF_TOKEN>

    # run on a single device
    tune run lora_dpo_single_device --config llama3_1/8B_lora_dpo_single_device

    # run on two gpus
    tune run --nproc_per_node 2 lora_dpo_distributed --config llama3_1/8B_lora_dpo

It's easy to get started with this recipe with your dataset of choice, including custom local datasets,
and datasets from Hugging Face. Check out our primer on :ref:`preference datasets <preference_dataset_usage_label>` to
see how to do this.

For this recipe we include different DPO-style losses:

* :class:`Direct Preference Optimization <torchtune.rlhf.loss.DPOLoss>` (DPO) loss [#]_. The DPO loss function
  increases the relative log-probabilities of preferred to un-preferred responses, whilst using log probabilities
  from a reference model to prevent policy degradation during training. Alongside RLHF, this is the most commonly used
  alignment technique and is used to train a growing number of state-of-the-art LLMs e.g. Llama3.1, Gemma 2, Qwen2, etc.
  This is a good starting point for alignment fine-tuning.
* :class:`Statistical Rejection Sampling Optimization <torchtune.rlhf.loss.RSOLoss>` (RSO) or "hinge" loss [#]_.
  RSO builds on concepts from support vector machines and DPO, applying a margin-based approach that penalizes
  low-quality responses while ensuring a significant gap between chosen and un-chosen log probabilities.

To use any of these, simply use the ``loss`` config entry or flag through the :ref:`cli_label`:

.. code-block:: bash

    tune run lora_dpo_single_device --config llama2/7B_lora_dpo_single_device \
    loss=torchtune.modules.loss.RSOLoss \
    gamma=0.5
