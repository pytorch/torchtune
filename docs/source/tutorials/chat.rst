Llama3 introduced a new prompt template for fine-tuning with chat data. In this tutorial,
we'll cover what you need to know to get you quickly started on preparing your own
custom chat dataset for fine-tuning Llama3.

Template changes from Llama2 to Llama3
--------------------------------------

The Llama2 chat model requires a specific template when prompting the pre-trained
model. Since the chat model was pretrained with this prompt template, if you want to run
inference on the model, you'll need to use the same template for optimal performance
on chat data. Otherwise, the model will just perform standard text completion, which
may or may not align with your intended use case.

From the `official Llama2 prompt
template guide <https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/meta-llama-2>`_
for the Llama2 chat model, we can see that special tags are added:

.. code-block:: text

    <s>[INST] <<SYS>>
    You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.
    <</SYS>>

    Hi! I am a human. [/INST] Hello there! Nice to meet you! I'm Meta AI, your friendly AI assistant </s>

Llama3 `overhauled <https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/meta-llama-3>`_
the template from Llama2 to better support multiturn conversations. The same text
in the Llama3 format would look like this:

.. code-block:: text

    <|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

    You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Hi! I am a human.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

    Hello there! Nice to meet you! I'm Meta AI, your friendly AI assistant<|eot_id|>

The tags are entirely different, and they are actually encoded differently than in
Llama2. Let's walk through tokenizing an example with the Llama2 template and the
Llama3 template to understand how.


Tokenizing prompt templates & special tokens
--------------------------------------------

Let's say I have a sample of a single user-assistant turn accompanied with a system
prompt:

.. code-block:: python

    sample = [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Who are the most influential hip-hop artists of all time?",
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Here is a list of some of the most influential hip-hop "
            "artists of all time: 2Pac, Rakim, N.W.A., Run-D.M.C., and Nas.",
        },
    ]

Now, let's format this with the :class:`~torchtune.data.Llama2ChatFormat` class and
see how it gets tokenized. The Llama2ChatFormat is an example of a **prompt template**,
which simply structures a prompt with flavor text to indicate a certain task.

.. code-block:: python

    from torchtune.data import Llama2ChatFormat, Message

    messages = [Message.from_dict(msg) for msg in sample]
    formatted_messages = Llama2ChatFormat.format(messages)
    print(formatted_messages)
    # [
    #     Message(
    #         role='user',
    #         content='[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.\n<</SYS>>\n\nWho are the most influential hip-hop artists of all time? [/INST] ',
    #         ...,
    #     ),
    #     Message(
    #         role='assistant',
    #         content='Here is a list of some of the most influential hip-hop artists of all time: 2Pac, Rakim, N.W.A., Run-D.M.C., and Nas.',
    #         ...,
    #     ),
    # ]

There are also special tokens used by Llama2, which are not in the prompt template.
If you look at our :class:`~torchtune.data.Llama2ChatFormat` class, you'll notice that
we don't include the :code:`<s>` and :code:`</s>` tokens. These are the beginning-of-sequence
(BOS) and end-of-sequence (EOS) tokens that are represented differently in the tokenizer
than the rest of the prompt template. Let's tokenize this example with the
:class:`~torchtune.modules.tokenizers.SentencePieceTokenizer` used by Llama2 to see
why.

.. code-block:: python

    from torchtune.modules.tokenizers import SentencePieceTokenizer

    tokenizer = SentencePieceTokenizer("/tmp/Llama-2-7b-hf/tokenizer.model")
    user_message = formatted_messages[0].content
    tokens = tokenizer.encode(user_message, add_bos=True, add_eos=True)
    print(tokens)
    # [1, 518, 25580, 29962, 3532, 14816, 29903, 6778, ..., 2]

We've added the BOS and EOS tokens when encoding our example text. This shows up
as IDs 1 and 2. We can verify that these are our BOS and EOS tokens.

.. code-block:: python

    print(tokenizer.spm_model.piece_to_id("<s>"))
    # 1
    print(tokenizer.spm_model.piece_to_id("</s>"))
    # 2

The BOS and EOS tokens are what we call special tokens, because they have their own
reserved token IDs. This means that they will index to their own individual vectors in
the model's learnt embedding table. The rest of the prompt template tags, :code:`[INST]`
and :code:`<<SYS>>` are tokenized as normal text and not their own IDs.

.. code-block:: python

    print(tokenizer.decode(518))
    # '['
    print(tokenizer.decode(25580))
    # 'INST'
    print(tokenizer.decode(29962))
    # ']'
    print(tokenizer.decode([3532, 14816, 29903, 6778]))
    # '<<SYS>>'

It's important to note that you should not place the special reserved tokens in your
input prompts manually, as it will be treated as normal text and not as a special
token.

.. code-block:: python

    print(tokenizer.encode("<s>", add_bos=False, add_eos=False))
    # [529, 29879, 29958]

Now let's take a look at Llama3's formatting to see how it's tokenized differently
than Llama2.

.. code-block:: python

    from torchtune.modules.tokenizers import TikTokenTokenizer

    tokenizer = TikTokenTokenizer("/tmp/Meta-Llama-3-8B/original/tokenizer.model")
    messages = [Message.from_dict(msg) for msg in sample]
    tokens, mask = tokenizer.tokenize_messages(messages)
    print(tokenizer.decode(tokens))
    # '<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a helpful, respectful,
    # and honest assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWho
    # are the most influential hip-hop artists of all time?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>
    # assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nHere is a list of some of the most influential hip-hop
    # artists of all time: 2Pac, Rakim, N.W.A., Run-D.M.C., and Nas.<|eot_id|>'

.. note::
    We used the ``tokenize_messages`` API for Llama3, which is different than
    encode. It simply manages adding all the special tokens in the correct
    places after encoding the individual messages.

We can see that the tokenizer handled all the formatting without us specifying a prompt
template. It turns out that all of the additional tags are special tokens, and we don't require
a separate prompt template. We can verify this by checking if the tags get encoded
as their own token IDs.

.. code-block:: python

    print(tokenizer._encode_special_token("<|begin_of_text|>"))
    # 128000
    print(tokenizer._encode_special_token("<|eot_id|>"))
    # 128009

The best part is - all these special tokens are handled purely by the tokenizer.
That means you won't have to worry about messing up any required prompt templates!


When should I use a prompt template?
------------------------------------

Whether or not to use a prompt template is governed by what your desired inference
behavior is. You should use a prompt template if you are running inference on the
base model and it was pre-trained with a prompt template, or you want to prime a
fine-tuned model to expect a certain prompt structure on inference for a specific task.

It is not strictly necessary to fine-tune with a prompt template, but generally
specific tasks will require specific templates. For example, the :class:`~torchtune.data.SummarizeTemplate`
provides a lightweight structure to prime your fine-tuned model for prompts asking to summarize text.
This would wrap around the user message, with the assistant message untouched.

.. code-block:: python

    f"Summarize this dialogue:\n{dialogue}\n---\nSummary:\n"

You can fine-tune Llama2 with this template even though the model was originally pre-trained
with the :class:`~torchtune.data.Llama2ChatFormat`, as long as this is what the model
sees during inference. The model should be robust enough to adapt to a new template.


Fine-tuning on a custom chat dataset
------------------------------------

Let's test our understanding by trying to fine-tune the Llama3-8B instruct model with a custom
chat dataset. We'll walk through how to set up our data so that it can be tokenized
correctly and fed into our model.

Let's say we have a local dataset saved as a CSV file that contains questions
and answers from an online forum. How can we get something like this into a format
Llama3 understands and tokenizes correctly?

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv', nrows=1)
    print("Header:", df.columns.tolist())
    # ['input', 'output']
    print("First row:", df.iloc[0].tolist())
    # [
    #     "How do GPS receivers communicate with satellites?",
    #     "The first thing to know is the communication is one-way...",
    # ]

The Llama3 tokenizer class, :class:`~torchtune.modules.tokenizers.TikTokenTokenizer`,
expects the input to be in the :class:`~torchtune.data.Message` format. Let's
quickly write a function that can parse a single row from our csv file into
the Message dataclass.

.. code-block:: python

    def message_converter(sample: Mapping[str, Any]) -> List[Message]:
        input_msg = sample["input"]
        output_msg = sample["output"]

        user_message = Message(
            role="user",
            content=input_msg,
            masked=True,  # Mask if not training on prompt
        )
        assistant_message = Message(
            role="assistant",
            content=output_msg,
            masked=False,
        )
        # A single turn conversation
        messages = [user_message, assistant_message]

        return messages

Since we're fine-tuning Llama3, the tokenizer will handle formatting the prompt for
us. But if we were fine-tuning a model that requires a template, for example the
Mistral-7B model which uses the :class:`~torchtune.modules.tokenizers.SentencePieceTokenizer`,
we would need to use a chat format like :class:`~torchtune.data.MistralChatFormat` to format
all messages according to their `recommendations <https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/open_weight_models/#chat-template>`_.

Now let's create a builder function for our dataset that loads in our local file,
converts to a list of Messages using our function, and creates a :class:`~torchtune.datasets.ChatDataset`
object.

.. code-block:: python

    def custom_dataset(
        *,
        tokenizer: Tokenizer,
        max_seq_len: int = 2048,  # You can expose this if you want to experiment
    ) -> ChatDataset:

        return ChatDataset(
            tokenizer=tokenizer,
            # For local csv files, we specify "csv" as the source, just like in
            # load_dataset
            source="csv",
            convert_to_messages=message_converter,
            # Llama3 does not need a chat format
            chat_format=None,
            max_seq_len=max_seq_len,
            # To load a local file we specify it as data_files just like in
            # load_dataset
            data_files="your_file.csv",
        )

.. note::
    You can pass in any keyword argument for :code:`load_dataset` into all our
    Dataset classes and they will honor them. This is useful for common parameters
    such as specifying the data split with :code:`split` or configuration with
    :code:`name`

Now we're ready to start fine-tuning! We'll use the built-in LoRA single device recipe.
Use the :code:`tune cp` command to get a copy of the :code:`8B_lora_single_device.yaml`
config and update it to use your new dataset.

.. code-block:: yaml

    dataset:
      _component_: path.to.my.custom_dataset
      max_seq_len: 2048

Launch the fine-tune!

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tune run lora_finetune_single_device --config custom_8B_lora_single_device.yaml epochs=15
