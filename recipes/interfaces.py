class FTRecipeInterface(Protocol):
    """
    This class provides a loose structure which every LLM fine-tuning recipe
    should follow. Please note that the interface itself should not be a vehicle for
    code reuse. TorchTune strictly prohibits implementation inheritance in the codebase.

    A few notes about the design and the need for this interface:
    - This interface is meant to help recipe-writers organize their code in a way
        which is easy to read, understand and extend. Minimizing code duplication is not
        the goal. Recipe-writers are encouraged to copy-paste-modify.

    - This interface is not meant to add constraints. If the interface comes in the
        way of doing stuff, it needs to be updated or a new interface should be
        written to support what might be a new "family" of recipes.
