class FullFinetuneRecipeSingleDevice(FTRecipeInterface):
    """
    Full finetuning recipe for dense transformer-based LLMs such as Llama2. This recipe is optimized
    for single GPU training. Training on CPU is not supported.

    Features:
        - Activation Checkpointing. This can be controlled using the ``activation_checkpointing``
            flag. Activation checkpointing helps reduce the memory footprint since we no longer keep
            activations in memory and instead recompute them during the backward pass. This is especially
            helpful for larger batch sizes when you're memory constrained. But these savings in memory
            come at the cost of training performance. In most cases training can slow-down quite a bit as
            a result of this activation recomputation.

        - Precision. Full fp32 and bf16 training are supported. Precision is controlled using the ``dtype``
            flag. When ``dtype=bf16``, all activations, gradients and optimizer states are in bfloat16. In
            most cases this should halve the memory footprint of full precision (fp32) training, without
            loss in model quality (will depend on the model, training data and other settings). For
            GPUs which do not support bfloat16, we fall back to fp32. Mixed precision training and fp16
            precision are currently not supported.

        - Gradient Accumulation. You can simulate larger batch sizes by accumulating gradients. This is
            controlled using the ``gradient_accumulation_steps`` flag.

                Total Batch Size = batch_size * gradient accumulation steps.

            For example: with batch_size=1 and gradient_accumulation_steps=32 we get a total batch size of 32.

            Gradient accumulation is especially useful when you are memory constrained. In this case,
            accumulating gradients might give you better training speed than enabling activation
            checkpointing.

        - Optimizer in Backward. Fusing the optimizer step into the backward pass helps reduce the memory
            footprint associated with gradients. This can be especially helpful when you are memory
            constrained. Note that users can only use ONE of gradient accumulation or optimizer in backward.
            These features currently do not work together. For more details on optimizer in backward, please
            see this tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/optimizer_step_in_backward_tutorial.html

        - Lower precision optimizers. This recipe supports lower-precision optimizers from the bitsandbytes
            library (https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/index). We've tested the recipe with
            8-bit AdamW and Paged AdamW. These optimizers are especially helpful when you are memory constrained
            since they help reduce the memory footprint associated with the optimizer states.

        - Checkpointing. Model weights are checkpointed both at the end of each epoch and at the end of
            training. Optimizer State and recipe state (seed, total_epochs, number of epochs run etc) are
            only saved at the end of a given epoch and used in case of resuming training.

            Resuming training is controlled by the ``resume_from_checkpoint`` flag. Mid-epoch checkpointing is
            currently not supported.

            For more details on the checkpointer, please take a look at
            our checkpointer deepdive (https://pytorch.org/torchtune/main/deep_dives/checkpointer.html).

        - Logging. Terminal, Disk, WandB and TensorBoard are all supported.

        - Gradient Clipping. Gradient clipping is supported using the ``clip_grad_norm`` flag. By default,
            ``clip_grad_norm`` is set to ``None``. If you only want to log the grad norm, you can set
            ``clip_grad_norm='inf'``.

    For a full list of example configs for this recipe, run ``tune ls`` on the command line. Each config
    has example commands for how to kick-off training.
