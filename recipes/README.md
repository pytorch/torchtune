# Training Recipes

&nbsp;

## What are Recipes?

Recipes are the primary entry points for TorchTune users. These can be thought of as end-to-end pipelines for training and optionally evaluating LLMs. Each recipe consists of three components:

- **Configurable parameters**, specified through yaml configs [example](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/torchtune/blob/main/recipes/configs/alpaca_llama2_full_finetune.yaml), command-line overrides and dataclasses
- **Recipe class**, core logic needed for training, exposed to users through a set of APIs [interface](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/torchtune/blob/main/recipes/interfaces.py)
- **Recipe script**, puts everything together including parsing and validating configs, setting up the environment, and correctly using the recipe class

## Recipe Design

Recipes in TorchTune are:

1. **Simple**. Written fully in native-PyTorch.
2. **Correct**. Numerical parity verification for every component and extensive comparisons with reference implementations and benchmarks.
3. **Easy to Understand**. Each recipe provides a limited set of meaningful features, instead of every possible feature hidden behind 100s of flags. Code duplication is preferred over unnecessary abstractions.
4. **Easy to Extend**. No dependency on training frameworks and no implementation inheritance. Users don't need to go through layers-upon-layers of abstractions to figure out how to extend core functionality.
5. **Accessible to a spectrum of Users**. Users can decide how they want to interact with TorchTune Recipes:
    - Start training models by modifying existing configs
    - Modify existing recipes for custom cases
    - Directly use available building blocks to write completely new recipes/training paradigms

## How to specify parameters for recipes

The arguments for a recipe are defined in a params object (such as `FullFinetuneParams`) that contains the full list of configurable parameters. These are either set to default values or sourced from the YAML file listed with `--config` and `--override` arguments in the `tune` CLI. The `TuneArgumentParser` class is responsible for parsing the provided config file and overrides and funneling it into the corresponding params object for the recipe the user wishes to run. The order of overrides from these parameter sources is as follows, with highest precedence first:

CLI &rarr; Config &rarr; Params defaults

The config is the primary entry point for users, with CLI overrides providing flexibility for quick experimentation.

## Examples

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/torchtune/blob/main/README.md#downloading-a-model) to download the Llama2 model and convert the weights.

### Full finetune

To run the `full_finetune` recipe with the `alpaca_llama2_full_finetune.yaml` config on four GPUs with FSDP, run this command:

```
tune --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node 4 finetune_llm --config alpaca_llama2_finetune
```

### LoRA finetune

We provide separate recipes for finetuning LoRA on a single device and multiple GPUs. You can finetune LoRA on a single device using the `lora_finetune_single_device` recipe with the `alpaca_llama2_lora_finetune_single_device.yaml` config. To do so on multiple GPUs, use `lora_finetune_distributed ` with `alpaca_llama2_lora_finetune_distributed.yaml`. E.g. on two devices, you can run the following:

```
tune --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node 2 lora_finetune_distributed --config alpaca_llama2_lora_finetune_distributed
```

For both recipes, activation checkpointing is enabled by default, and LoRA weights are added to the Q and V projections in self-attention. FSDP is enabled by default for
distributed recipe. If you additionally want to apply LoRA to K and would like to reduce the LoRA rank from the default of eight, you can run

```
tune --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node 2 lora_finetune_distributed --config alpaca_llama2_lora_finetune_distributed --override lora_attn_modules=q_proj,k_proj,v_proj lora_rank=4
```

### Generation

To run the generation recipe, run this command from inside the main `/torchtune` directory:
```
python -m recipes.alpaca_generate --native-checkpoint-path /tmp/finetune-llm/model_0.ckpt --tokenizer-path ~/llama/tokenizer.model --input "What is some cool music from the 1920s?"
```
