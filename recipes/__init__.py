# This file mainly exists because we want to ensure that `recipes` aren't
# importable *from the tests*.
# We're using the `prepend` pytest import mode which adds the root dir (i.e. the
# parent of torchtune/, tests/, recipes/) to the pythonpath during pytest
# sessions
# (https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/explanation/pythonpath.html#import-modes).
# This has the positive effect that the `tests` folder becomes importable when
# testing (we need that, considering how tests are currently set up) but ALSO
# has the negative effect of making the `recipes/` importable when testing.
# Since we don't want the tests to to incorrectly assume that recipes are
# importable, we have to explicitly raise an error here.

# TODO: Add proper link to pytorch.org/torchtune/... when the docs are live.
raise ModuleNotFoundError(
    "The torchtune recipes directory isn't a package and you should not import anything from here. "
    "Refer to our docs for detailed instructions on how to use recipes!"
