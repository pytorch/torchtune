class QATLoRAFinetuneRecipeDistributed(FTRecipeInterface):
    """
    Distributed quantization-aware training (QAT) and LoRA finetuning recipe for dense transformer-based
    LLMs such as Llama2. This recipe supports distributed training and can be run on a single node (1 to
    8 GPUs).

    Features:
        - Quantization-aware training (QAT). Perform fake quantization on weights and/or activations
            during finetuning, with the goal of ultimately producing a quantized model with minimal
            accuracy degradation. This recipe produces an unquantized model in the original dtype,
            which can then be quantized separately.

        - FSDP. Supported using PyTorch's FSDP APIs. CPU offload of parameters, gradients, and optimizer states
            is supported via ``fsdp_cpu_offload``. Resharding of parameters after the forward pass is
            done by default (corresponding to FULL_SHARD sharding strategy), but can be disabled by setting the config
            ``fsdp_reshard_after_forward`` to False (this corresponds to SHARD_GRAD_OP sharding strategy).
            DDP is currently not supported. Training on CPU is not supported.

        - Activation Checkpointing. This can be controlled using the ``enable_activation_checkpointing``
            flag. Activation checkpointing helps reduce the memory footprint since we no longer keep
            activations in memory and instead recompute them during the backward pass. This is especially
            helpful for larger batch sizes when you're memory constrained. But these savings in memory
            come at the cost of training performance. In most cases training can slow-down quite a bit as
            a result of this activation recomputation.

        - Activation Offloading. This can be controlled using the ``enable_activation_offloading``
            flag. Activation offloading is a technique similar to activations checkpointing that helps
            reduce the memory footprint to prevent OOMs on CUDA and enable bigger batches. Where activations
            checkpointing drops the activation in the forward to recompute it later in the backward,
            activations offloading will drop the activation in the forward to the CPU and bring it
            back during the backward pass. As always, there is a tradeoff--these savings in memory can
            come at the cost of training performance and CPU resources. To recover some runtime cost,
            we've added an option to enable offloading on a different stream to permit overlapping with
            the computation. This option is currently only available on PyTorch 2.5.0 or later and will be
            enabled by default if an acceptable torch version is found. Activation offloading can be used in
            conjunction with activation checkpointing.

        - Precision. Full fp32 and bf16 training are supported. Precision is controlled using the ``dtype``
            flag. When ``dtype=bf16``, all activations, gradients and optimizer states are in bfloat16. In
            most cases this should halve the memory footprint of full precision (fp32) training, without
            loss in model quality (will depend on the model, training data and other settings). For
            GPUs which do not support bfloat16, we fall back to fp32. Mixed precision training and fp16
            precision are currently not supported.

        - Gradient Accumulation. You can simulate larger batch sizes by accumulating gradients. This is
            controlled using the ``gradient_accumulation_steps`` flag.

                Total Batch Size = batch_size * number of GPUs * gradient accumulation steps.

            For example: with batch_size=1, nproc_per_node=2 and gradient_accumulation_steps=32 we get a
            total batch size of 64.

            Gradient accumulation is especially useful when you are memory constrained. In this case,
            accumulating gradients might give you better training speed than enabling activation
            checkpointing.

        - Checkpointing. Model weights are checkpointed both at the end of each epoch and at the end of
            training. Currently we checkpoint both the adapter weights (trainable params only) and the
            complete merged weights (adapter weights added back to the base model). For more details
            please take a look at our LoRA tutorial
            (https://pytorch.org/torchtune/main/tutorials/lora_finetune.html).

            Optimizer State and recipe state (seed, total_epochs, number of epochs run etc) are
            only saved at the end of a given epoch and used in case of resuming training. Resuming
            training is controlled by the ``resume_from_checkpoint`` flag. Mid-epoch checkpointing is
            currently not supported.

            For more details on the checkpointer, please take a look at
            our checkpointer deepdive (https://pytorch.org/torchtune/main/tutorials/checkpointer.html).

        - Logging. Terminal, Disk, WandB and TensorBoard are all supported.

        - Gradient Clipping. Gradient clipping is supported using the ``clip_grad_norm`` flag. By default,
            ``clip_grad_norm`` is set to ``None``. If you only want to log the grad norm, you can set
            ``clip_grad_norm='inf'``.

    For a full list of example configs for this recipe, run ``tune ls`` on the command line. Each config
    has example commands for how to kick-off training.
