The player seems to offer events to support this, but I am struggling to get correct timings from it.\n\nWhen the user skips through a video the player emits the following events in order: pause, seeking, seeked, play.\n\nIf I query the player object at any of these events using currentTime() the result is always the end time for the seek, even on the initial pause event. This means I can log where the seek ended but not where it started.\n\nCan anyone help me to find the position in the video where the seek begins?\n\nIf this is not possible, I'd settle for a way to disable seeking during playback.\n\nEDIT: adding code as requested.

While this worked in some browsers like Chrome, unfortunately, I found that other browsers continued to fire timeupdate more frequently and would continue to update the currentTime() I was saving after the player actually seeked.\n\nHere was the solution that ultimately worked across Safari\/Chrome\/Firefox.
